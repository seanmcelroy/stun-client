stun-client
======

A .NET Core implementation of the STUN protocol that can be used to create an
STUN client, based on IETF RFC 5389.  This repository features a classlib which
can be referenced, and a small example console application that demonstrates
its ability to connect to a STUN server over either UDP or TCP, send a binding
request, and parse a response.

Pull requests or questions are welcome!
