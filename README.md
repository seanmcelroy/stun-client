stungun
======

A .NET Core implementation of the STUN protocol based on IETF RFC 5389.

```./client``` contains a sample STUN client that can connect to a STUN server
over either UDP or TCP.  It is a simple wrapper around the classlib components.
This is a console-based application.

```./common``` is the classlib that contains the core message and attribute
components, as well as the client and server protocol implementations.  If you
want to implement your own STUN agent, this project contains the classes you
will want.

```./common.tests``` is a set of unit tests that validate the functionality
in the common classlib.

```./server``` contains a very simple UDP STUN server.  It will respond to STUN
requests with the MappedAttribute and XorMappedAttribute attributes.  Building
the project and running it with ```dotnet server.dll``` will start the server.
